Parser and Grammar:
    All code parses correctly into a parse tree. Parse tree contains information about
    programs, statements, and expressions. The line number associated with the tree node
    is provided for semantic checking purposes.

    See tree.h and tree_types.h for the explicit structure of a parse tree.

    TODO:
        - Some line numbers are buggy, requires grammar editing
        - No mod or div operators yet
        - Function return checking is not robust (doesn't check if outside if-else, etc.)

Code Generation (64-bit Intel x86):
    Work in progress
