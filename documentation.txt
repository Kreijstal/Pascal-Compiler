Parser and Grammar:
    All code parses correctly into a parse tree. Parse tree contains information about
    programs, statements, and expressions. The line number associated with the tree node
    is provided for semantic checking purposes.

    See tree.h and tree_types.h for the explicit structure of a parse tree.

    TODO:
        - Some line numbers are buggy, requires grammar editing
        - No mod or div operators yet
        - Function return checking is not robust (doesn't check if outside if-else, etc.)
        - Ensure built-ins "read" and "write" get one variable as argument (limited expression)

64-bit Intel x86:
    rbp is the base pointer, rsp is the stack pointer

    Arguments:
        The first is placed in rdi, the second in rsi, the third in rdx, and then rcx, r8 and r9.
        All future arguments placed on the stack


NOTES ON GCC:
    example header:
        .file	"t1.c"
        .text
        .section	.rodata
        .LC0:
        .string	"%d\n"
        .text
        .globl	main
        .type	main, @function
        
    Note that the .globl and .type seem to define which function generated the label
    and not necessarily who can call it (tested by changing the names to another func)

    footer for main (will update with laptop values):
        .size	main, .-main
    	.ident	"GCC: (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04) 7.3.0"
    	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
