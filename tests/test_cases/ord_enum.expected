Testing Ord with enum constants:
Ord(Red) = 0
Ord(Green) = 1
Ord(Blue) = 2
Ord(Yellow) = 3
Ord(Small) = 0
Ord(Medium) = 1
Ord(Large) = 2
Testing Ord with enum variables:
Ord(color) = 1
Ord(size) = 2
Ord(Blue) + Ord(Medium) = 3
Red is first enum value (ordinal 0)
Large is third enum value (ordinal 2)
All Ord tests completed successfully!
