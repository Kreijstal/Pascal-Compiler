{ Minimal FGL (Free Pascal Generic Library) unit
  
  NOTE: This compiler doesn't support full generics yet.
  This is a stub unit that allows code using FGL to compile
  when generics/templates are manually specialized.
  
  For now, this file intentionally empty - users must define
  specialized versions of TFPGList for their types.
